To override the default behavior of a process when it receives a signal, use signal(2).
```C
sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler)
```
A signal list with description for each of them is available in :
```console
/usr/include/bits/signum-generic.h
```

As manual notes says, the behavior of a process is undefined after it ignores a SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by kill(2) or raise(3). So don't use that to hide program bugs.
